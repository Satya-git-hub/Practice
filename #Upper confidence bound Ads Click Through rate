Step 1: At each round n, we consider two numbers for each ad i:
        - Ni (n) - the number of times ad i was selected upto round n,
        - Ri (n) - the sum of rewards of the ad i up to round n 
        
Step 2: From these two numbers we compute:
        - the average reward of ad i up to round n 
                
                ri(n) = Ri(n) / Ni(n)
        
        - the confidence interval [ri(n) - deltai(n), ri(n) + deltai(n)]
                deltai = sqrt(3 * log(n) / 2 * Ni(n))
